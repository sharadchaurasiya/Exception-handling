    "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
    "-  In interpreted language Code is read and executed line by line by an interpreter at          runtime but In compiled language code is compile before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "-   Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows you to deal with unexpected          errors gracefully, rather than letting them crash your program. Python uses the try and      except blocks to handle exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "-  The finally block in Python exception handling ensures that certain code runs no matter      what—whether an exception occurs or not. It’s commonly used for cleanup operations like      closing files, releasing resources, or disconnecting from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is logging in Python ?\n",
    "-  Logging in Python is a way to track events that happen while a program runs, making it       easier to debug and monitor applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "-  The __del__ method in Python is a special method known as the destructor. It is            automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when it goes       out of scope or is explicitly deleted using del.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
    "-  Import imports the entire module but from ... import imports the specific function or      variable from  a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python0?\n",
    "-  I can handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or a single except block     with multiple exception types.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
    "-  The with statement in Python is used for handling files because it ensures that            resources are properly managed, even if an error occurs. It automatically closes the       file after the block of code is executed, making code cleaner and reducing the risk of     forgetting to close a file manually.\n",

    "      Example: A web server handling multiple requests using threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Multiprocessing\n",
    "   1.Uses multiple processes, each with its own memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2.Better for CPU-intensive tasks, like image processing or data crunching.\n",

    "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "-   Here are the basic steps involved in exception handling in pyhton:\n",
    "    1. Use a try Block\n",
    "       Wrap the code that might raise an exception inside a try block.\n",
    "    2. Catch Exceptions with except\n",
    "       If an error occurs, the except block executes instead of stopping the program.\n",
    "    3. Use finally (Optional)\n",
    "       The finally block always executes, no matter what—great for cleanup tasks.\n",
    "    4. Raise Exceptions (Optional)\n",
    "       You can manually trigger exceptions using the raise statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "-   Memory management import in python , in these terms :\n",
    "    1.Prevents Memory Leaks\n",
    "     Unused objects are removed via garbage collection, avoiding excessive memory               consumption.\n",

    "   except block: Handles the error if an exception occurs, preventing the program from        stopping unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "15.  How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
    "-   Python’s garbage collection system is designed to automatically manage memory by           removing unused objects, preventing memory leaks and optimizing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
    "-  else block provides a way to execute code only if no exceptions occur in the try block.    It helps separate error-handling logic from regular code, making programs cleaner and      more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
    "-   Common Logging Levels:\n",
    "    1.DEBUG (10) – Used for detailed diagnostic messages, typically during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.INFO (20) – General informational messages to indicate program execution.\n",
    "   3.WARNING (30) – Signals potential issues that don’t stop execution but should be            monitored.\n",
    "   4.  ERROR (40) – Used when something goes wrong, but the program can still continue\n",
    "   5.CRITICAL (50) – Indicates severe issues that require immediate attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
    "-   1. os.fork() (Unix-based systems only)\n",
    "    Creates a child process by duplicating the current process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The child process inherits the parent’s memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Efficient for lightweight process creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Only available on Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS).\n",

    "     Example using multiprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
    "-   Closing a file in Python is important because it ensures that system resources are         freed and that data is properly written to disk. If a file remains open, it can lead       to memory leaks, data corruption, or issues with other programs accessing the file.\n",
    "\n",

    "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
    "-   Challenges in Python Memory Management:\n",
    "    1.Memory Leaks\n",
    "     If objects remain referenced but are no longer needed, they can cause leaks.\n",
    "     Example: Large data structures held in global scope never get freed.\n",
    "    2.Circular References\n",
    "    Two or more objects referencing each other can prevent automatic garbage collection.\n",
    "    Python's garbage collector detects circular references, but not always efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "     3.Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n",
    "     Limits Python’s ability to fully utilize multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "     Can lead to inefficient memory usage in multi-threaded applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.High Memory Consumption\n",
    "     Python's dynamic typing requires extra memory overhead.\n",
    "     Small objects (integers, strings) may consume more memory due to object metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5.Fragmentation in Long-running Programs\n",
    "    Continuous allocation and deallocation can lead to fragmented memory.\n",
    "    Can reduce efficiency in applications that run indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
    "-   In Python, you can manually raise an exception using the raise statement. This is          useful when you want to handle specific errors in your program or enforce conditions       that must be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
    "-   Multithreading is essential in certain applications because it enables concurrent execution, improving performance and responsiveness. While Python has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that limits CPU-bound threading, multithreading is still highly effective for I/O-bound tasks."
